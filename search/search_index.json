Some guidelines: Read the Roadmap / Vision Go through the issue list and if needed create a relevant issue to discuss the change design. On disagreements, maintainer(s) will have the final word. You can expect a response from a maintainer within 7 days. If you haven\u2019t heard anything by then, feel free to ping the thread. This package tries to be as simple as possible for the user (hide any complexity from the user). Options are only added when there is clear value to the majority of users. When issues or pull requests are not going to be resolved or merged, they should be closed as soon as possible. This is kinder than deciding this after a long period. Our issue tracker should reflect work to be done. Unit Tests Make sure to install an editable version before running tests: pip install - r tests / test_requirements . txt pip install - e . pytest -- cov = mkdocs_git_authors_plugin -- cov - report term - missing tests If it makes sense, writing tests for your PRs is always appreciated and will help get them merged. In addition, this project uses pyflakes for static code checking: pip install pyflakes pyflakes tests / mkdocs_git_authors_plugin / Manual testing To quickly serve a website with your latest changes to the plugin use the sites in our tests suite. For example: pip install - r tests / test_requirements . txt pip install - e . mkdocs serve - f ./ tests / basic_setup / mkdocs_complete_material . yml Code Style Make sure your code roughly follows PEP-8 and keeps things consistent with the rest of the code.
